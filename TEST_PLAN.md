- [ ] **Test responsive design**: Check on different screen sizes
- [ ] **Test haptic feedback**: Verify on mobile device

### Edge Cases
- [ ] **Empty search results**: Search for non-existent service
- [ ] **Form validation**: Submit form with missing fields
- [ ] **Navigation**: Test back button behavior
- [ ] **Deep linking**: Test direct navigation to specific screens

### Performance
- [ ] **App startup time**: Should load within 2-3 seconds
- [ ] **Navigation speed**: Screen transitions should be smooth
- [ ] **Search performance**: Results should appear within 300ms
- [ ] **Memory usage**: Monitor for memory leaks

## Known Limitations

1. **Document Upload**: Currently simulated (need real camera/gallery integration)
2. **Payment Gateway**: Mock implementation (need real payment provider)
3. **User Authentication**: Not implemented (would need in production)
4. **Offline Support**: Not implemented (would enhance user experience)
5. **Push Notifications**: Not implemented (would need backend service)

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Connect to real government APIs

   - Set up database for application tracking

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Real document upload with OCR
   - Payment gateway integration (bKash, Nagad, etc.)
   - Push notifications for application status
   - Offline mode support

3. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Unit tests with Jest
   - E2E tests with Detox
   - Performance testing
   - Security audit

4. **Deployment**
   - App Store submission
   - Google Play Store submission
   - Progressive Web App deployment
